The interface hardware was created using KiCad (http://kicad-pcb.org/).

The interface implements three S0 inputs from the energy meters.

The Modbus interface is using a Hjelmslund Electronics USB485 USB stick (http://www.hjelmslund.dk/).
(The interface hardware created in KiCad was originally ment to also implement a RS-485 interface
but I am currently not able to solder surface mount components after having a 
stroke some time ago. Hopefully I will get better and be able to do more serious
hardware design).
