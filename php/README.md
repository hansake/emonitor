Interface towards the user is done with PHP scripts. Graphics is created using Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG). 
Due to pure laziness a new php file was created for each new month that data was collected as it is rather easy 
just to write a new date in the PHP script to show a new month.
This was later changed to a common php file called from small php files for each year and month.
