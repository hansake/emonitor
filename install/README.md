You need to have a fairly good idea when and how to make scripts executable, when to copy files as root (using sudo), 
how to activate init.d scripts etc.

Install your favourite web server.

The Python scripts in "emonitor" and "pow-mon" are placed in: "/usr/local/bin"

The start scripts in "emonitor" and "pow-mon" are placed in: "/etc/init.d"

The PHP scripts in "php" are placed in: "/var/www/html"

The SQLite databases will be created in: "/var/db"
